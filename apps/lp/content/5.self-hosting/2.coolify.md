---

The Coolify self-host option is the easiest way to get started with Shelve. Coolify is a platform that allows you to deploy applications with a single click. To self-host the Shelve application using Coolify, follow these steps:

::steps{level="4"}

#### Copy the Coolify [Docker Compose file](https://github.com/HugoRCD/shelve/blob/main/docker/app-compose.coolify.yml)
#### Add a new resource in Coolify and select the `Docker Compose Empty` option.
#### Select your server and paste the contents of the `app-compose.coolify.yml` file.
#### Then go to the `Environment Variables` tab and add the necessary environment variables.
#### The only required environment variable are the OAuth client ID and secret. You can get these by creating a new OAuth application on GitHub or Google. Other variable will be automatically set by Coolify [Magic Variables](https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/docker/compose#coolifys-magic-environment-variables).
#### Click the `Deploy` button to start the deployment process.
#### Once the deployment is complete, you can access the application by clicking the `Link` button.
#### That's it! You have successfully self-hosted the Shelve application using Coolify.

Ensure you have a Coolify account and a server set up before following these steps. For more information on Coolify, refer to the [official Coolify documentation](https://coolify.io/docs/).
