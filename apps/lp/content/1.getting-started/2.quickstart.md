::steps{level="3"}

### Create an account

Sign up for a Shelve account on [Shelve](https://app.shelve.cloud) :prose-icon{name="custom:shelve"}.
Or if you prefer to self-host, follow the instructions in the [Self-hosting](/self-hosting/docker) guide.
Once you have an account, complete the onboarding process to create your first team (workspace).

### Install the Shelve CLI package

::code-group{sync="pm"}

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add -D @shelve/cli
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add -D @shelve/cli
```

```bash [npm]
npm install -D @shelve/cli
```

```bash [bun]
bun add -D @shelve/cli
```

::

::callout
You can also install the CLI globally using the `-g / --global` flag of your package manager.
::

### Connect the CLI to your account

You will need a token to authenticate the CLI with your account. You can generate a token in your account settings on the [Shelve App](https://app.shelve.cloud/user/tokens).
Once you have your token, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
shelve login
```

This will prompt you to enter your token. Once you have entered your token, you will be logged in and ready to use the CLI.

:::accordion-item{label="Can I use the CLI with my self-hosted instance?" icon="i-lucide-badge-help"}
Before running the `shelve login` command, you can set the URL of your self-hosted instance in a manually created `shelve.json` file in the root of your project. The file should look like this:

```json [shelve.json]
{
  "url": "https://your-instance-url.com"
}
```

:::

:::accordion-item{label="Can i use the CLI with multiple accounts?" icon="i-lucide-users"}
No, the CLI only supports one account at a time. If you need to switch accounts, you will need to log out and log back in with the new account.
:::

:::accordion-item{label="can i use the CLI in a CI/CD pipeline, for example, GitHub Actions?" icon="i-lucide-refresh-cw"}
Actually, there is no way to use the CLI in a CI/CD pipeline. However, we are working on a complete solution for this use case, by using flags in the CLI commands to specify the token and the URL of the instance for example.
:::

:::accordion-item{label="What if I forget my token?" icon="i-lucide-search"}
If you forget your token, you can always generate a new one in your account settings on the [Shelve App](https://app.shelve.cloud/user/tokens).
