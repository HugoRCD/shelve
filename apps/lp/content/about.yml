      Shelve, like many tools developers rely on, started from a common frustration.
      Managing multiple projects meant constantly wrestling with sharing `.env` files and environment variables across teams.
      Existing solutions often felt overly complex or locked behind expensive plans – even elegant approaches like Vercel's weren't universally accessible.
      :br
      Tired of the copy-paste grind and seeking a **simpler, more open alternative**, I began building a CLI tool.
      The initial goal was modest: make sharing and managing environment variables straightforward and secure.
      But it quickly became clear that the need for an **accessible**, **developer-focused** solution ran deeper.
  - title: Building the Foundation

      Choosing the right technology was crucial.
      **Nuxt** emerged as the ideal foundation, not just for its technical power, but because its focus on **Developer Experience (DX)**
      mirrored the core philosophy intended for Shelve.
      :br
      Leveraging Nuxt allowed Shelve to be built with a focus on **real-time updates, a seamless user interface (thanks to Nuxt UI)**, and **robust security**,
      all without sacrificing the elegant simplicity we aimed for.
      It proved essential in crafting a tool that is both powerful under the hood and intuitive to use daily.
      Shelve became, in part, a demonstration of how a focus on great DX in the framework translates directly into a better end-product for users.
  - title: 'Beyond Secrets: The Vision'

      Shelve's journey is just beginning. The vision extends beyond secrets management towards a unified **developer workspace** –
      a central hub designed to streamline critical development workflows and eliminate friction.
      Every feature is meticulously crafted with **Developer Experience** as the guiding principle,
      aiming for that feeling of "this is how it _should_ work."
      :br
      The roadmap includes deeper integrations, managing configurations beyond just secrets (imagine syncing dotfiles or CI templates across repos!),
      powerful automation, and smarter collaboration tools – all integrated seamlessly.
      The goal? To give developers back their most valuable asset: **time and focus**.
      :br
      Continuous UI refinement is key, aiming for elegance and moments of delight in every interaction.
      But fundamentally, Shelve remains committed to its core values: **open-source, accessible, secure, and built _for developers_**.
      In an ecosystem often trending towards closed, expensive tooling,
      Shelve champions the idea that powerful tools can, and should, empower everyone.
      :br
      Stay tuned – there's much more to build.
