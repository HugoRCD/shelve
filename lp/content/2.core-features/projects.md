Projects are the core of Shelve, a project is a collection of environment variables and secrets, but it can also contain other resources like quick links, files (soon), and more.

### Variables

Variables are key-value pairs that store environment configurations and secrets. You can create variables for different environments like development, staging, production, or even custom environments.
Check the [Variables](/core-features/variables) page for more information.

### Quick Links

Quick links are shortcuts to external resources like documentation, repositories, or any other URL. You can create quick links for your project to easily access external resources without leaving Shelve in the settings tab.

### Files (soon)

Files will be a new feature that allows you to store files in your project. You can upload files like certificates, images, or any other file type to your project. Files will enable you to store all your project resources in one place.

### Repository
The repository serves as a link to your project's repository. You can connect your project to a GitHub repository to synchronize your secrets with GitHub secrets. By linking your project to a repository, you enhance Shelve's capabilities, enabling you to automatically synchronize your secrets with GitHub secrets, which simplifies the management of your secrets across your projects. But don't worry, your secrets are always encrypted and secure.

You will benefit from a lot more features in the future !
