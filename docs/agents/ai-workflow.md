# AI Collaboration Rules

- If the user says a result is not what they want or asks for a change in approach, propose updating `AGENTS.md` or a file in `docs/agents/` with a concrete patch before repeating the mistake.
- Keep `AGENTS.md` minimal. Add non-universal guidance to a new or existing file in `docs/agents/` and link it from `AGENTS.md`.
- Only add instructions that are specific and actionable. Avoid vague directives.
- When you are unsure where a new rule belongs, ask the user before editing the instructions.
