## 📋 Overview

> **Shelve provides the secure foundation for effortless secrets management.** Stop juggling `.env` files and scattered keys. Bring clarity, security, and synchronization to your application configurations.

Shelve tackles the common frustrations of managing environment variables and secrets in modern development: the security risks, the collaboration friction, and the time wasted on manual processes. We provide a centralized, secure, and intuitive platform designed from the ground up with developer experience as the priority.

### 🎯 The Vision

While Shelve excels at secrets management today, our vision extends further. We are building towards a unified **developer workspace** – a central hub designed to streamline critical development workflows, eliminate friction, and integrate seamlessly with the tools you already use. Secrets management is the cornerstone, but the goal is broader productivity and flow.
