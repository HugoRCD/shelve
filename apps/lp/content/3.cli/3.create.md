The `create` command enables you to initiate a new project in Shelve. When you execute the `create` command, if there is no configuration file located in the current directory, you will be asked to provide the project name (which will be automatically filled with the current package name specified in the `package.json` file), along with the project description, repository URL, and homepage URL.

```bash [terminal]
shelve create
```
