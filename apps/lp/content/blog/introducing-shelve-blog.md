Welcome to Shelve's official blog! ðŸ‘‹

As Shelve continues to grow and evolve, I wanted to create a space where I could share more detailed insights about the project, its development, and the future I envision for it.

### Why Start a Blog?

Building in public has always been part of Shelve's DNA. While Twitter is great for quick updates, some topics deserve a deeper dive. This blog will be the place for:

- Technical deep-dives into Shelve's architecture
- Behind-the-scenes of new features
- Tutorials and best practices
- Project updates and roadmap discussions

### What's Coming

The next few months are exciting for Shelve. With the recent migration to Nuxt Hub, we're unlocking new possibilities that will transform how developers manage their environments. Expect articles about:

- How Shelve leverages AI for smarter environment management
- Deep dives into our new file upload system
- Best practices for team environment sharing
- And much more!

### Join the Journey

Shelve started with a simple goal: make environment management less painful for developers. Today, it's growing into something much bigger, and I'm excited to share this journey with you.

Whether you're a long-time user or just discovering Shelve, I hope this blog will give you valuable insights into modern development workflows and tools.

Stay tuned for more articles, and feel free to reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/HugoRCD__) with topics you'd like to see covered!

Happy coding! âœ¨
