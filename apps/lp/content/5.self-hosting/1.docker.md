# Self-Hosting with Docker

Shelve provides official Docker images and a Docker Compose configuration for easy self-hosting. This guide will walk you through the process of deploying Shelve using Docker.

## Docker Images

Official Shelve images are available on GitHub Container Registry. You can pull the latest version or a specific one:

```bash
# Pull latest version
docker pull ghcr.io/hugorcd/shelve:latest

# Pull specific version
docker pull ghcr.io/hugorcd/shelve:v2.0.0.beta-11
```

If you opt for the image setup, you will have to provide the necessary services (PostgreSQL, Redis) and connect them manually by setting the required environment variables:
- `DATABASE_URL`
- `NUXT_PRIVATE_REDIS_URL`

## Docker Compose

The recommended way to deploy Shelve is using Docker Compose, which will handle all the required services (PostgreSQL, Redis) and their configuration.
Check the [Docker Compose file](https://github.com/HugoRCD/shelve/blob/main/docker/app-compose.community.yml) for the community version or [app-compose.coolify.yml](https://github.com/HugoRCD/shelve/blob/main/docker/app-compose.coolify.yml) for the Coolify version.

To deploy Shelve using Docker Compose, follow these steps:

::steps{level="4"}

#### Copy the Docker Compose file.
#### Create the `.env` file with the required environment variables. You can find the list of required variables in the Docker Compose file.
#### Run the following command to start the services:

```bash
docker-compose -f app-compose.community.yml up -d
```

#### Access the application by navigating to `http://localhost:3000`.
#### That's it! You have successfully self-hosted the Shelve application using Docker Compose.

### Health Checks

The Docker Compose configuration includes health checks for all services:
- Shelve application: Checks the API endpoint every 30 seconds
- PostgreSQL: Verifies database connectivity
- Redis: Ensures Redis is responding

### Resource Management

The configuration includes resource limits to ensure stable operation:
- CPU: 1 core limit, 0.5 core reserved
- Memory: 1GB limit, 512MB reserved

### Data Persistence

Data is persisted using Docker volumes:
- postgres: PostgreSQL data
- redis: Redis data
These volumes ensure your data survives container restarts.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, check the container logs:
```bash
# All services
docker compose logs

# Specific service
docker compose logs <service-name>
```

For more detailed logs, you can find them in the JSON log files (limited to 10MB per file, 3 files maximum).


### Upgrading
To upgrade Shelve, pull the latest image and restart the services:

::steps{level="4"}

#### Pull the latest image:
```bash
docker compose pull
```

#### Restart the services:
```bash
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

## Security Considerations
- Always use strong, unique values for sensitive environment variables
- Consider using a reverse proxy with SSL termination
- Regularly update to the latest version for security patches
- Restrict network access as needed
