## Project Introduction

Shelve is an all-in-one development workspace that simplifies environment management and project collaboration. With Shelve, developers can easily manage environment variables, collaborate on projects, and enhance their development workflow.

### Project Vision
Shelve aims to become the go-to development workspace for developers. From creating projects to managing environments, Shelve provides a seamless experience for developers worldwide.

### Current Status and Future Ambitions
Shelve is currently in active development, with a focus on adding new features and improving existing functionalities.

The key features of the future version of Shelve will include:
- Ecosystem management (Syncing files across multiple repositories for example) to make big ecosystem like [UnJs](https://unjs.io) easier to manage.
- Support for more integrations like GitHub, Vercel, Coolify, by syncing environment variables and project settings.
- Powerful project creation with automatic setup (auto GitHub repository creation, auto Vercel deployment, etc.) Ready to use in seconds.
- Major UI improvements to make Shelve one of the most beautiful and easy-to-use development tools.
