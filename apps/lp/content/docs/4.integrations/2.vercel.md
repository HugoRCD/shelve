Shelve integrates with Vercel to sync your environment variables directly to your Vercel projects. This keeps your deployments up to date with the latest configuration from Shelve.

## Getting Started

### Connect Your Vercel Account

1. Go to **User Settings** → **Integrations**
2. Click **Connect** next to Vercel
3. Authorize Shelve to access your Vercel projects

### Link Projects

1. Open your project settings in Shelve
2. In the **Integrations** section, click **Link with Vercel**
3. Select the corresponding Vercel project from the list

## Syncing Variables

Once your project is linked, you can sync variables when creating them:

1. Create new variables as usual
2. Toggle **Sync with Vercel** when creating variables
3. Variables will automatically be pushed to your Vercel project

## Environment Mapping

Shelve maps your environments to Vercel environments:

- `development` → Vercel `development`
- `preview`, `staging` → Vercel `preview`
- `production`, `prod` → Vercel `production`
- Other environments → Vercel `preview`

## Important Notes

- Variables will overwrite existing ones with the same key in Vercel
- Be careful with variables set by external providers (Neon, Redis, etc.)
- Only linked projects can sync variables to Vercel
