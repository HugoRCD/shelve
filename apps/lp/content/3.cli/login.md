The `login` command allows you to authenticate with Shelve CLI, which is required to access your Shelve projects securely.

```bash [terminal]
shelve login
```

When you run the `login` command, you will be prompted to enter a token. You can find your token in the Shelve dashboard under the `API Tokens` tab.

For the moment, you cannot add multiple users, if you want to change the user, you need to log out and log in again.
