## Login

The `login` command allows you to authenticate with Shelve CLI, which is required to access your Shelve projects securely.

```bash [terminal]
shelve login
```

When you run the `login` command, you will be prompted to enter a token. You can find your token in the Shelve dashboard under the [`API Tokens`](https://app.shelve.cloud/user/tokens) tab.

::warning
For the moment, you cannot add multiple users, if you want to change the user, you need to log out and log in again.
::

### Me

The `me` command allows you to view your user information.

```bash [terminal]
shelve me
```

## Logout

The `logout` command allows you to log out from Shelve CLI.

```bash [terminal]
shelve logout
```

This will delete the token stored in your local machine and log you out from Shelve CLI.
