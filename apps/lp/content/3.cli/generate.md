The `generate` will prompt you to select the type of file you want to generate.

```bash [terminal]
shelve generate
```

## Env Example

The `.env.example` option allows you to generate an example `.env` file in your project. This file contains the environment variables required to run your project locally but does not contain any sensitive information. You can use this file as a template to create your own `.env` file.
